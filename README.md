# Github Actions Workflows

We want to use Github Actions at Socotra, and to maintain a collection of
common reusable workflows for our projects. Unfortunately, currently Github
Actions does not support calling a reusable workflow in a private repository.
Thus, **this repository is public**, so one should be **extremely careful**
about what gets committed here, so as not to divulge any sensitive information.
